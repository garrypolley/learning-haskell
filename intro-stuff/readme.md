# Intro Stuff

This is me running through: http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out

The items in `baby.hs` are for me to see how Haskell works.

A few things that took me a bit to "get":

* `[3,4,2] == [3,4,2]` - this type of lexical comparison and knowing that it goes all the way down the lists comparing
* `[2,4..20]` -- the `2` and the `4` are the "base" numbers and the `20` is where you are going. So it'll expand the series by the distance between the `2` and `4`. (This tripped me up for a bit, I kept thinking the `4` was related to the `20`, when it was really the relationship between `2` and `4` that mattered)
